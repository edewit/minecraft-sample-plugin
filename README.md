# minecraft-sample-plugin

This repository is an example of how to create a [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/) based minecraft plugin.
You can use this as a base to start creating your own plugins.

Or you can use this together with [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) [Minecraft plugin image](https://github.com/edewit/minecraft-sponge-plugin-s2i) and get this running on [openshift](https://www.openshift.com/)
